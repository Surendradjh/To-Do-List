# To-Do-List
 This is a simple Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) application for managing a to-do list, where users can add, view, update, complete, and delete tasks. The app also supports time-based task allocation and stores tasks in a MySQL database. The functionality is extended with triggers to move deleted tasks into a "previous tasks" table.
